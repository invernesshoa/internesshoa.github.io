When more than one person or entity holds an interest in any lot or building site, all such persons or entities shall be members.  The vote for such lot or building site shall be exercised as such persons or entities may determine, but in no event shall more than one vote be cast with respect to any lot or building site.  Until the happening of the earlier of the events set forth in paragraph 33 below, there shall be two classes of voting membership, as set forth in said paragraph 33.

4.	Covenant for Maintenance Assessments.

<blockquote>
<p>
(a)	Creation of the Lien and Personal Obligation of Assessments.  Declarant, for each lot within the Properties, hereby covenants, and each Owner of any lot or building site, by acceptance of the deed therefor, whether or not it shall be so expressed in such deed, is deemed to covenant and agree to pay to the Association:  (1) annual assessments or charges, and (2) special assessments for capital improvements, such assessments to be established and collected as hereinafter provided.  The annual and special assessments, together with interest, costs and reasonable attorney's fees, shall be a charge on the interest in the land against which such assessment is made.  Each such assessment, together with interest, costs and reasonable attorney's fees, shall also be the personal obligation of the person who was the Owner of such property at the time when the assessment fell due.  The personal obligation for delinquent assessment shall not pass to his successors in title unless expressly assumed by them.

<p>
(b)	Purpose of Assessments.  The assessments levied by the Association shall be used exclusively to promote the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Properties and for the improvement and maintenance of the Common Area and specifically for maintenance of the entrance, road right-of-way landscaping, Island landscaping, fencing along Bayou Boulevard, and the cleaning of debris from lots or building sites on which a residential dwelling has not yet been constructed.

<p>
(c)	Maximum Annual Assessment.  Until January 1 of the year immediately following the conveyance of the first lot or building site to an Owner, the maximum annual assessment shall be $48.00 per lot or building site, or $12.00 per quarter per lot or building site, payable quarterly in advance.

<blockquote>
<p>
(i)	From and after January 1 of the year immediately following the conveyance of the first lot to an Owner, the maximum annual assessment may be increased each year not more than 15% above the maximum assessment for the previous year without a vote of the membership.

<p>
(ii)	From and after January 1 of the year immediately following the conveyance of the first lot to an Owner, the maximum annual assessment may be increased above 15% by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the members who are voting in person or by proxy, at a meeting duly called for this purpose.

<p>
(iii)	The Board of Directors may fix the annual assessment at an amount not in excess of the maximum assessment.
</blockquote>

<p>
(d)	Special Assessments for Capital Improvements.  In addition to the annual assessments authorized above, the Association may levy, in any assessment year, a special assessment applicable to that year only for the purpose of defraying, in whole or in part, the cost of any construction, reconstruction, repair or replacement of a capital improvement upon the Common Area, including fixtures and personal property related thereto, provided that any such assessment shall have the assent of two thirds, (2/3) of the votes of the members who are voting in person or by proxy at a meeting duly called for this purpose.

<p>
(e)	Notice and Quorum for Any Action Authorized Under this Paragraph.  Written notice of any meeting called for the purpose of taking any action authorized hereunder shall be sent to all members not less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days in advance of the meeting.  At the first such meeting called, the presence of members or of proxies entitled to cast thirty-five percent, of all the votes shall constitute a quorum.  If the required quorum is not present, another meeting may be called subject to the same notice requirement, and the required quorum at the subsequent meeting shall be one-half (1/2) of the required quorum at the preceding meeting.  No such subsequent meeting shall be held more than sixty (60) days following the preceding meeting.

<p>
(f)	Uniform Rate of Assessment.  Both annual and special assessments must be fixed at a uniform rate for all lots or building sites and may be collected on a quarterly basis.

<p>
(g)	Date of Commencement of Annual Assessment Due Dates.  The annual assessments provided for herein shall commence as to all lots or building sites at such time as is fixed by the Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors shall fix the amount of the annual assessment against each lot or building site at least thirty (30) days in advance of each assessment period.  Written notice of the first assessment and each annual assessment thereafter shall be sent to every Owner subject thereto.  The due dates shall be established by the Board of Directors.  The Association shall, upon demand, and for a reasonable charge, furnish a certificate signed by an officer of the Association setting forth whether the assessments on a specified lot or building site have been paid.  A properly executed certificate of the Association as to the status of assessments on a lot or building site is binding upon the Association as of the date of its issuance.

<p>
(g)	Effect of Non-payment of Assessments:  Remedies of the Association.  Any assessment payments not paid within thirty (30) days after the due date shall accelerate the due date of the entire assessment and shall bear interest from the due date at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum.  The Association may bring an action at law against the Owner personally obligated to pay the same, or foreclose the lien against the lot or building site.  No Owner may waive or otherwise escape liability for the assessments provided for herein by non-use of the Common Area or abandonment of his lot or building site.

<p>
(h)	Subordination of the Lien to Mortgages.  The lien of the assessments provided for herein shall be subordinate to the lien of any first mortgage.  Sale or transfer of the interest in any lot or building site shall not affect the assessment lien.  However, the sale or transfer of the interest in any lot or building site pursuant to mortgage foreclosure or any proceeding in lieu thereof, shall extinguish the lien of such assessments as to payments which became due prior to such sale or transfer.  No sale or transfer shall relieve such lot or building site from liability for any assessments thereafter becoming due or from the lien thereof.
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>
From and after the happening of these events, whichever occurs earlier, the Class B member shall be deemed to be a Class A member entitled to one vote for each lot or building site which is owned by said Class B member. The Declarant shall not exercise its voting rights granted to it under this Article in an unreasonable manner nor in such a way as to cause undue hardship upon any Owner.
</blockquote>

<p>
34.	As long as there is a Class B membership, the following actions will require the prior approval of the Federal Housing Administration or the Veterans Administration:  Annexation of additional properties, dedication of Common Area, and amendment of this Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions.
